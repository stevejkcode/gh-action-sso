# gh-action-sso
Demonstration repo of GitHub Actions used for SSO onboarding. Users can fill out an SSO onboarding request (under issues on GitHub) and Terraform code is automatically generated and committed to build and maintain an entry within their respective identity provider. A pull request is additionally generated and linked back to the issue which gives admins a chance to review each onboarding request. Once the PR is approved and merged, a second action is used to run Terraform plan and apply to build the new entry on Keycloak. *Note* that Keycloak is used in this demonstration but this could be modified to work for anything with an available Terraform provider.
